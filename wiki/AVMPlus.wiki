#summary AVMPlus API.

== Introduction ==

This API is specific to *redshell* (avmshell) running on the command-line.

In short, anything that is considered native goes into the *avmplus* AS3 package.


== Implementation ==

Tamarin provide *avmplus.System* and *avmplus.File*.

We updated and changed *avmplus.System*<br>
and removed *avmplus.File* (replaced by *avmplus.FileSystem*).


And we plan to add more, for ex: *avmplus.Process*, *avmplus.Host*, etc.


*Wishlist and/or priority:*

 * file system: add a complete set of features to deal with files, directories, paths, etc.
 * operating system: obtain detailled informations about the system
 * Socket: basic raw sockets, client and server
 * full support of stdin, stdout, stderr
 * process: controlling another executable and connecting to its stdin, stderr, stdout
 * IPC: Inter-Process Communication so we can implement native *LocalConnection*

== Limitation ==

Because we want redtamarin to stay a [CrossPlatform cross platform] tool we may not implement some features specific to a particular Operating System.

With some exceptions, for example, being able to access the Windows registry could be usefull.
