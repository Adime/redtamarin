#summary Working with redtamarin.

Everything you need to know on how to use redtamarin<br>
aka "I don't want to compile C/C++/Java, I just want to write AS code dammit".

=== First Thing First ===

The project is named *redtamarin*, but you end up using an executable named *redshell*.

So what is this "shell" thingy ?

The same you can have the Flash Player as a plugin on the browser (or the standalone flash projector) that can take a `*.swf` file and play it, you have the `redshell` that can take either a `*.swf` or `*.abc` files and execute them.

WHAT ? redshell can play `*.swf` files ?

yes, but don't get too excited, redshell can play only the `*.abc` parts inside the `*.swf`.

See it like that, either you want to execute only one `*.abc`, and so you pass it directly to redshell,
or you want to execute numerous `*.abc` one after another, and then you pass a `*.swf` file that act as a container for those different `*.abc` files.

Also you can run `*.as` files with redshell, but here again there are some limitations.

Assuming you are an AS3 developer, here the workflow you get with redtamarin
 * you compile your `*.as` files using the redtamarin API (or not) into one or more `*.abc` file(s)
 * compile, test, unit test, etc. ...  rinse and repeat
 * once you are happy with it, you can distribute
   * an abc file that can be used as a library (like a swc if you prefer)
   * redshell + your abc file
   * redshell + your swf file (containing different abc files)
   * your file exe (redshell embedding the abc file)
   * your file exe (redshell embedding a swf file that contains different abc files)
* you can generate different executable (for Windows, OS X, Linux, etc.)

Ultimately, your goal is to produce a command-line executable that you code in AS3.

=== Who 's talking about it ? ===

One strange thing with redtamarin is that I didn't promoted it much and still it reached 600+ downloads.

I talk a little bit about it on twitter (you can follow me if you want [http://twitter.com/#!/zwetan @zwetan]).
