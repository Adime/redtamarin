everything you need to know to compile, setup, etc.

You will probably need to [http://code.google.com/p/maashaack/wiki/Tools Set up your development environment] before being able to compile ASC, Tamarin, etc.


Here some additions for compiling C/C++

=== Windows ===

You need to install *Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition* (or later version)<br>
[ http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/default.aspx]

note:<br>
have a hotmail/msn account ready<br>
open VC++ and click help/register (use IE, chrome or firefox does not work)

You need to install Mozilla Build [http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-1.4.exe MozillaBuildSetup-1.4]<br>
and add `C:\mozilla-build\msys\bin` to your environment variables<br>
see [https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions/Windows_Prerequisites#MozillaBuild]

Configure cygwin bash to run VS C++ on the command line

open your .bash_profile and add
{{{
# NOTE: The INCLUDE, LIB and LIBPATH must contain windows path information and separator and not cygwin paths.
VS_HOME_PATH="/c/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0"
VS_HOME="c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0"

export PATH="$VS_HOME_PATH/Common7/IDE:$VS_HOME_PATH/VC/bin:$VS_HOME_PATH/Common7/Tools:$VS_HOME_PATH/VC/VCPackages:$PATH"
export INCLUDE="$VS_HOME\VC\atlmfc\include;$VS_HOME\VC\include;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Include;"
export LIB="$VS_HOME\VC\atlmfc\lib;$VS_HOME\VC\lib;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Lib"
export LIBPATH="$VS_HOME\VC\atlmfc\lib;$VS_HOME\VC\lib;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Lib"
}}}

misc:<br>
if you have limited RAM the build could end up with a fatal error, be sure to have at least 2GB of RAM (eg. for a VM setup).


=== OS X ===

You need to install the Developer Tools (the 2nd install DVD) or you can download them here [http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/]<br>
this will install Xcode, make, etc.

=== Linux ===
(I'm testing on Ubuntu 8.04 so if you have another flavour adapt accordingly)

You need to install *build-essential*
{{{
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
}}}
(strangely this basic thing can be a stopper for more than one)

form that all should be smooth.
