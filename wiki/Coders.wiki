everything you need to know to compile, setup, etc.

You will probably need to [http://code.google.com/p/maashaack/wiki/Tools Set up your development environment] before being able to compile ASC, Tamarin, etc.


Here some additions for compiling C/C++

=== Windows ===

You need to install *Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition* (or later version)<br>
[ http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/default.aspx]

note:<br>
have a hotmail/msn account ready<br>
open VC++ and click help/register (use IE, chrome or firefox does not work)

You need to install Mozilla Build [http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-1.4.exe MozillaBuildSetup-1.4]<br>
 and add `C:\mozilla-build\msys\bin` to your environment variables

=== OS X ===


=== Linux ===
(I'm testing on Ubuntu 8.04 so if you have another flavour adapt accordingly)

You need to install *build-essential*
{{{
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
}}}
(strangely this basic thing can be a stopper for more than one)
