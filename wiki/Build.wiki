#summary HOWTO Build.

=== Introduction ===

Basically we follow the same process than Tamarin<br>
see [https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Tamarin/Tamarin_Build_Documentation Tamarin Build Documentation].

But we got all that wrapped up in a nice Ant build to automate a couple of things.

=== Dependencies ===

 * you need a 64bit Operating System to build everything<br>the build will work on a 32bit system but you will nto be able to build 64bit targets, nor the SDK, etc.
 * you need Python 2.6+
 * you need Ant 1.8+
