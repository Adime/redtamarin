for ex:
{{{
#!/bin/sh
 
clear
ls -l -a
}}}



== Making a wrapper shell script ==

let's say you have your script<br>
*hello.as*
{{{
trace( "hello world" );
}}}

that you would want to run directly as a shell script

you could simply do that<br>
*hello*
{{{
#! /bin/sh

/usr/share/redtamarin/redshell hello.as -- $@
}}}

don't forget to make the shell script executable
{{{
$ sudo chmod +x hello
}}}

and then run it
{{{
$ ./hello
}}}
when "hello" run, the shell will replace `$@` with any arguments you provided.
