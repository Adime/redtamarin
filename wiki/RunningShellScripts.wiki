#summary running AS3 or ABC as shell scripts.

== Introduction ==

What is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script Shell Script] ?
<pre>
A shell script is a script written for the shell, or command line interpreter, of an operating system.
It is often considered a simple domain-specific programming language.
Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.
</pre>

In the Linux world most of shell scripts will use a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) shebang]<br>
for ex:
{{{
#!/bin/sh
 
clear
ls -l -a
}}}



== Making a wrapper shell script ==

let's say you have your script<br>
*hello.as*
{{{
trace( "hello world" );
}}}

that you would want to run directly as a shell script

you could simply do that<br>
*hello*
{{{
#! /bin/sh

/usr/share/redtamarin/redshell hello.as -- $@
}}}

don't forget to make the shell script executable
{{{
$ sudo chmod +x hello
}}}

and then run it
{{{
$ ./hello
}}}
when "hello" run, the shell will replace `$@` with any arguments you provided.



== Registering an extension as non-native binaries (Linux only) ==

Because this is a Linux-specific feature, we do not recommend that developers deploy this solution,<br>
as it would limit the portability of their scripts.<br>
(but yeah under a Linux distro this is so f*cking cool)

In short, this make use of *binfmt_misc*, here the introduction from [http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt the documentation]
<pre>
This Kernel feature allows you to invoke almost (for restrictions see below)
every program by simply typing its name in the shell.
This includes for example compiled Java(TM), Python or Emacs programs.

To achieve this you must tell binfmt_misc which interpreter has to be invoked
with which binary. Binfmt_misc recognises the binary-type by matching some bytes
at the beginning of the file with a magic byte sequence (masking out specified
bits) you have supplied. Binfmt_misc can also recognise a filename extension
aka '.com' or '.exe'.
