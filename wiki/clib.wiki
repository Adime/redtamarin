#summary The C Standard Library.

== Introduction ==

From the beginning, redtamarin added a bit of support for C-like functions and packages.

We were calling that "a more or less standard C library" ;).

Now, as we want to do the right thing, we want to provide as much support as possible, put things at the right place and avoid shortcuts if possible.

The main principle still is the same

if you have this in *C*
{{{
//C
#include <stdlib.h>

//char *getenv( const char *name );
char *test = getenv("HOME");
}}}

then you can have this in *AS3*
{{{
//AS3
import C.stdlib.*;

//public function getenv( name:String ):String;
var test:String = getenv( "HOME" );
}}}

these are the main reasons to do that

  # in general, C give you a low-level universal access to things<br/>wether you know `chmod()` on the command line or you used `mkdir()` in PHP, Python, etc. you already used a bit of *C* somewhere
  # building uppon this kind low-level you can build bigger things<br/>in our case we will reuse `mkdir()` to define `FileSystem.makeDirectory()`<br/>maybe you want to build your own API or do things a bit differently<br/>if yonly you had access to `mkdir()`...well you have access
  # etc
