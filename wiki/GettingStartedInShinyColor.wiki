#summary Getting Started in More Details and Shiny Color.

Here a small tutorial from start to finnish<br>
to get you started writing code for redtamarin in Flex Builder 3.0<br>
<br>
It should work the same for Flash Builder 4.0, but I didn't tested yet.

== Introduction ==

You still need to do the default Getting Started
  * [GettingStarted#Download_the_shell Download the shell]
  * a
  * b


== Define a workspace ==

Because redtamarin is not your default Flex Builder project, I would advise you to create an Eclipse workspace dedicated to redtamarin development.
