#summary Getting Started in More Details and Shiny Color.

Here a small tutorial from start to finnish<br>
to get you started writing code for redtamarin in Flex Builder 3.0<br>
<br>
It should work the same for Flash Builder 4.0, but I didn't tested yet.

== Introduction ==

You still need to do the default [GettingStarted Getting Started] tasks
  * [GettingStarted#Download_the_shell Download the shell]
  * [GettingStarted#Download_the_component Download the component]
  * [GettingStarted#Build_the_tools Build the tools]


== Define a workspace ==

Because redtamarin is not your default Flex Builder project,<br>
I would advise you to create an Eclipse workspace dedicated to redtamarin development.

[http://redtamarin.googlecode.com/svn/gfx/gettingstarted/redtamarin_workspace.png]

Each Eclipse workspace have a `.metadata` folder containing various settings,<br>
here with one of the tools we have built, we gonna inject a bunch of external tools into this folder.

Here what we have by default
[http://redtamarin.googlecode.com/svn/gfx/gettingstarted/tools_default.png]

run !EclipseExternalTools 
{{{
$ ./EclipseExternalTools /work/Demos/redtamarin
}}}
[http://redtamarin.googlecode.com/svn/gfx/gettingstarted/running_EclipseExternalTools.png]

if you go into the folder `.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.debug.core/.launches/`<br>
you will see that list of scripts we just added
[http://redtamarin.googlecode.com/svn/gfx/gettingstarted/eclipse_list_launches.png]

Now, close Flex Builder and restart it.

== Edit our tools first ==

Let's open the external tools
[http://redtamarin.googlecode.com/svn/gfx/gettingstarted/open_external_tools.png]

On the top left, you should see our list of tools
[http://redtamarin.googlecode.com/svn/gfx/gettingstarted/List_of_external_tools.png]

Now, open the external tools favorite<br>
and add all the tools (eg. click "Organize favorites...")
[http://redtamarin.googlecode.com/svn/gfx/gettingstarted/add_external_tools_to_favorites.png]

Select the order that you prefer with "move up", "move down", etc.

And now, let's see our tools
[http://redtamarin.googlecode.com/svn/gfx/gettingstarted/List_of_tools.png]

Here a summary of those tools
|| *tool*  || *description* || *alternative to* ||
|| ASC_compile || compile an *.as file with ASC || Flex Builder MXMLC compiler ||
|| redshell_debug || run an .abc file with redshell_d || Debug button ||
|| redshell_run || run an .abc file with redshell || Run button ||
|| make_projector || take an *.abc file and create an executable || n/a ||
|| dump_api || take an *.abc or *.swf file and dump the API || n/a ||
|| dump_infos || take an *.abc or *.swf file and dump the infos || n/a ||
|| extract_abc || take a *.swf file and dump all the *.abc files || n/a ||



== Our first test project ==

Create an !ActionScript project named "test"
