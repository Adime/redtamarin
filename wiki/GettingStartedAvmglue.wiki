== Details ==

After following the [GettingStarted getting started] instructions

1. you will need to add *avmglue.swc* next to *redtamarin.swc*

for ex:
{{{
..
  |_ bin
  |    |_ ...
  |
  |_ src
  |   |_ ...
  |
  |_ lib-swc
      |_ redtamarin.swc
      |_ avmglue.swc
}}}
<br>
<br>

2. you will need to update your *bin* folder with *avmglue.abc*

{{{
..
 |_ bin
     |_ abcdump
     |_ asc
     |_ asc.ajr
     |_ avmglue.abc     <- here
     |_ builtin.abc
     |_ createprojector
     |_ EclipseExternalTools
     |_ redshell
     |_ redshell_d
     |_ swfmake
     |_ toplevel.abc
}}}
<br>
<br>

3. and finally you will need to update your tools

copy *ASC_compile* to *ASC_compile_avmglue*

update the task from
{{{
Location: ${project_loc}/bin/asc
Working Directory: ${project_loc}/bin/
Arguments: -AS3 -strict -import builtin.abc -import toplevel.abc ${resource_loc}
}}}

to
{{{
Location: ${project_loc}/bin/asc
Working Directory: ${project_loc}/bin/
Arguments: -AS3 -strict -import builtin.abc -import toplevel.abc -import avmglue.abc ${resource_loc}
}}}
<br>

copy *redshell_debug* to *redshell_debug_avmglue*

update the task from
{{{
Location: ${project_loc}/bin/redshell_d
Working Directory: ${project_loc}/src/
Arguments: ${resource_loc}
}}}

to
{{{
Location: ${project_loc}/bin/redshell_d
Working Directory: ${project_loc}/src/
Arguments: ../bin/avmglue.abc ${resource_loc}
}}}
