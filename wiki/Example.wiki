Here you'll find some small code snippet to illustrate the use of redtamarin.

The first goal of redtamarin is to allow people to use C functions from ActionScript

if in C you got
{{{
#include <stdlib.h>

char *home = getenv("HOME");

}}}

then in ActionScript you can do
{{{
import C.stdlib.*;

var home:String = getenv("HOME");

}}}


= unistd =

{{{
import C.unistd.sleep;

trace( "sleep 5sec..." );
sleep( 5 ); //in seconds
trace( "...and wake up" );
}}}

{{{
import C.unistd.getcwd;

trace( "current working directory: " + getcwd() );
}}}
