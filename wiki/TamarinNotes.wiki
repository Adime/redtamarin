#summary notes about Tamarin.

== Introduction ==

Some personal notes about Tamarin, can be howto, recipe, things to remember, etc.


== I consider this code C/C++ ==

When you're a noob like me and try to find informations on the web,  forums etc.<br>
you will see two camps: the pure ANSI C crowd vs the pure C++ crowd<br>
and yes I understand that C and C++ are not the same thing.

and it get even get worst when you include the different version of C, C89 vs C99,<br>
the different operating systems, C under Linux vs C under Windows, etc.

to be honest, I don't give a shit<br>
I need my code to work with Tamarin without breaking it<br>
and still being cross-platform,<br>
so whatever Tamarin does, I will follow the same path.

Now in the case of Tamarin, I consider the code to be C/C++, and here why

Most of the time they keep the type used to the strict minimum,<br>
for ex if a C++ String could be used, a char array is used,<br>
or if a C++ vector could be used, again a char array is used,<br>
etc.

My logic is that the guys from Adobe, Mozilla, etc. know a hell lot better than me about C/C++<br>
do they try to make things harder for the noob like me?<br>
no I don't think so<br>
so why they don't use things that to me look simpler ?<br>
it must have to do with cross platform portability and performance

So, for things like VMPI, let's say the low-level stuff, even if things are structured as C++ classes,<br>
the underlying implementation is what I could call "pure C".

And only when you arrive around native classes implementations that you can see<br>
more advanced types used, like `Stringp`, `ArrayObject`, etc.

Yeah, depending at which "layer" you are working<br>
the code will feel C'ish or C++'ish<br>
hence why I call that C/C++.


== C++ Constructor(s) vs AS3 Constructor ==

Native classes can be a kind of special beast sometime,<br>
and here the constructor case is very very special.

If you come from an AS3 background and you spend a bit of time<br>
researching how you can optimize your code, you probably heard<br>
Adobe telling you that you should keep your constructors "light"<br>
as "don't initialize too much code in your AS3 constructors".

see [Tamarin] - Performance Tuning<br>
slide 43<br>
{{{
 Interpret vs. JIT
  * We make a simple "hotspot"-like decision about wether to interpret or JIT
  * Initialization functions ($init, $cinit) are interpreted
  * Everything else is JIT
  * Upshot: Don't put performance-intensive code in class initialization
}}}

OK, that's one part of the story, here the second part from a C++ point of view.

When you define a native class, you basically define 4 things
 * a C++ base class, ex: `ByteArrayClass`
 * a C++ instance class, ex: `ByteArrayObject`
 * an AS3 class definition using the keyword `native`, ex: `ByteArray.as`
 * an AS3 metadata that link the C++ definitions to the AS3 definition
  {{{
package flash.utils
{

    [native(cls="::avmshell::ByteArrayClass", instance="::avmshell::ByteArrayObject", methods="auto")]
    public class ByteArray
    {
    //...
    }

}
  }}}


== Creating a !ByteArray on the C++ side  ==

{{{
ByteArrayObject* bytes;

//you first need a ByteArray class that you instanciate from your nativeID definition
ByteArrayClass *ba = (ByteArrayClass*)toplevel()->getBuiltinExtensionClass(NativeID::abcclass_flash_utils_ByteArray);

//default arguments
Atom args[1] = {nullObjectAtom};

//then you build the ByteArray instance from a ScriptObject
bytes = (ByteArrayObject*)AvmCore::atomToScriptObject(ba->construct(0, args));

//not sure if this is necessary but seems safer to reset the ByteArray to zero
bytes->setLength(0);
}}}

the AS3 equivalent is
{{{
var bytes:ByteArray = new ByteArray();
}}}
