#summary Frequently Asked Questions.

 * *What's the main difference with [http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/ Tamarin] ?*
 Tamarin focus on VM and optimization (like GC, nanoJIT, etc.), redtamarin focus on shell and APIs.

 * *Why use SVN when Tamarin use [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/ Mercurial] ?*
 Mainly because [http://code.google.com/hosting/ Google Project hosting] use SVN and because I prefer SVN (yep arbitrary choice).

 * *Which Operating System are supported ?*
 Most of the ones that Tamarin supports, mainly OS X, Windows and Linux (Ubuntu),
 but others as Windows CE could also be supported (testers welcome).

 * *Why not Java or .NET ?*
 Because they do not work with the Tamarin VM and do not support the AS3 language.

 * *Why the focus on command-line tools with !ActionScript 3 ?*
 Because it's missing in the regular AS3 toolchain and command-line tools can save your butt
 on numerous occasions.

 * *What are `*.abc` files ?*
 Actionscript !ByteCode files generated by the !ActionScript Compiler ([https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Tamarin_Build_Documentation#Compiling_and_running_applications ASC]).

 * *How an executable is generated from `*.abc` ?*
 ASC have options that allow you to produce an `*.exe` that basically embed an `*.abc` file.

 * *Does the executable have dependencies ?*
 Nope. You obtain a single independant executable.

 * *Are they similar tools out there ?*
 Yes, look at [http://www.jsdb.org/ JSDB], it's the same principle, it's the [http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/ SpiderMonkey engine] running on the command-line that can embed !JavaScript files in a single executable.

 * *What's the use of the C libraries (stdlib, etc.) under AS3 ?*
 On one part, it promotes the porting of C source code to AS3 source code, that way some AS3 coder can extends those command-line tools more easyly with their language of choice (AS3), and on another part, it promotes C coders to get interested at the AS3 language without missing C functions they are used to.

 * *What's the use of the flash platform APIs ?*
 It allows to port existing AS3 source code, targeted at the [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ Flash player] or [http://www.adobe.com/products/air/ AIR], to work on the command-line.
