#summary unistd.h for AS3.

<wiki:comment>
Because we are defining libraries for Tamarin we can not really use asdoc to document the source code.
So the rule is to document everything in the wiki page.
Yeah it sucks because we have to sync by hand, we'll try to automate it later.

on the source code file, we use only one comment

= Functions =

== access ==
{{{
public function access( path:String, mode:int ):int
}}}
Determine accessibility of a file.

*since:* 0.3.0


== chdir ==
<font color="red">not implemented for UNIX/WIN32</font><br>
{{{
public function chdir( path:String ):int
}}}
Change working directory.

*since:* 0.3.0

== chmod ==
{{{
public function chmod( path:String, mode:int ):int
}}}
Change mode of a file.

*note:*<br>
under WIN32 chmod is limited, you will only be able to set read or write at the user level<br>
`chmod( "myfile.txt", S_WRITE );`<br>
will be the same as<br>
`chmod( "myfile.txt", (S_IWUSR | S_IWGRP | S_IWOTH ) );`

*since:* 0.3.0


== getcwd ==
{{{
public function getcwd():String
}}}
Get the pathname of the current working directory.

*since:* 0.3.0


== gethostname ==
{{{
public function gethostname():String
}}}
Get the name of the current host.

*since:* 0.3.0


== getlogin ==
{{{
public function getlogin():String
}}}
Get the login name of the current user.

*since:* 0.3.0


== mkdir ==
{{{
public function mkdir( path:String ):int
}}}
Make directory.

*since:* 0.3.0


== rmdir ==
{{{
public function rmdir( path:String ):int
}}}
Remove directory.

*since:* 0.3.0


== sleep ==
{{{
public function sleep( milliseconds:uint ):void
}}}
Suspend execution for an interval of time.

*note:*<br>
`sleep()` in C usually use seconds, here we are using milliseconds.
