Welcome to the redtamarin project.

[http://code.google.com/p/redtamarin/w/list list all the wiki pages]

Simply put, redtamarin is based on the [http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/ Tamarin] project
(eg. the Flash Player Virtual Machine) and allow to run AS3 code on the command-line.

But because Tamarin only support the AS3 builtins (Object, Array, etc.),
redtamarin add numerous native functionalities, so you can test if your program
run under Windows or Linux, or read/write files, or send data with sockets, etc.

Put another way, if Adobe AIR allow you to build desktop executable with a GUI,
redtamarin allow you to build desktop executable with a CLI.

=== Mission Statement ===

*To support the use of the AS3 language for cross-platform command-line executable,
as single exe either for the desktop or the server, as scripts for automation,
as tools for the Flash Platform community.*


=== history ===

At first I was using a mixed system to update from Mercurial and then sync to a local subversion repository and then sync to the google code project, then later I was using another mixed system that was mixing directories from both the Tamarin mercurial repo and this project SVN repo, both were not practical, hard to update.

Also, messing a little too much with the Tamarin source code, I ended up having dirty C/C++ code.

Since the Tamarin release *703:2cee46be9ce0* ([https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Tamarin/Tamarin_Releases 02/12/2008]), I decided to make it cleaner.

Now from redtamarin v0.2, the source code of Tamarin is fully sync'ed in this project repository, and as the C/C++ is better organized, update etc. should stay clean in the  futur :). *<-- this has failed big time*

As of *25/07/2010* redtamarin have taken a completely different approach
 * now we use the [http://code.google.com/p/redshell/ redshell] project to stay in sync' with [http://hg.mozilla.org/tamarin-redux tamarin-redux] (sync is done every week)
 * from redshell, we do an `hg archive` and overwrite the `/tamarin-redux` directory, see [http://code.google.com/p/redtamarin/source/detail?r=252 this change] for example.
 * etc. (TODO explain the other changes)

The code is currently tested and compiled on those systems:
 * Mac OS X 10.6.2
 * Windows XP SP3
 * Linux Ubuntu 8.04.3 Desktop
 * more to come (especially 64bit versions)

contributors welcome, even if it just compiling on your system :).
