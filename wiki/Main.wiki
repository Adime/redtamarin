= Introduction =

here you will find some infos on how to setup
redtamarin and use it.


= Compiling =

redtamarin is based on the [http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/ tamarin] source code
and so follow the same principle for the [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Tamarin_Build_Documentation compilation and build].

but as redtamarin source is on svn and tamarin source is on mercurial
this require a special setup.

== how to setup ==

 1. create a working directory

{{{
$ mkdir working-directory
}}}

 2. then checkout tamarin with mercurial

{{{
$ cd working-directory
$ hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/tamarin-central tamarin-central
}}}

you should have this structure now
{{{
..
  |_ working-directory
       |_ tamarin-central
}}}

 3. also get the zlib module (needed to compile under windows)

{{{
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot
 export -r HEAD mozilla/modules/zlib
}}}

copy the module to have this structure
{{{
..
  |_ modules
  |      |_ zlib
  |           |_ ...
  |
  |_ working-directory
       |_ tamarin-central
}}}

 4. then checkout redTamarin inside tamarin-central

{{{
$ cd tamarin-central
$ svn checkout http://redtamarin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/RED/src/ red
}}}

your final structure should look like that
{{{
..
  |_ modules
  |      |_ zlib
  |           |_ ...
  |
  |_ working-directory
       |_ tamarin-central
             |_ axscript
             |_ build
             |_ codegen
             |_ core
             |_ ...
             |_ red  <- here our code from svn
}}}

== how to compile ==

for now I support only OS X and Windows
(Linux should be able to compile too but untested)

to compile under windows use
{{{
../working-directory/tamarin-central/red/platform/win32/redtamarin_8.sln
}}}

note:
this is a solution for Visual C++ Express 2008
it's what I use, maybe you'll need some tweaks to make it work with other compilers.

to compile under OS X use
{{{
../working-directory/tamarin-central/red/platform/mac/redshell/redshell.xcodeproj
}}}

it should work in any Xcode

= Testing =

Wether you compile your own redshell executable or want to run those executable

you will need another tool: the !ActionScript Compiler, or in short ASC
you can find the [http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Get+Source+Code source of asc.jar in the Flex SDK]

Follow [http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Setup their instructions to compile the Flex SDK]

this is required so you can compile *.as to *.abc
and then run the *.abc with the redshell executable
