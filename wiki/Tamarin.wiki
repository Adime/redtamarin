#summary about the Tamarin project.

=== Introduction ===

<pre>
The goal of the "Tamarin" project is to implement a high-performance,
open source implementation of the !ActionScript™ 3 language,
which is based upon and extends ECMAScript 3rd edition (ES3).

 !ActionScript provides many extensions to the ECMAScript language,
including packages, namespaces, classes, and optional strict typing of variables.
"Tamarin" implements both a high-performance just-in-time compiler and interpreter. 

 The Tamarin virtual machine is used within the Adobe® Flash® Player
and is also being adopted for use by projects outside Adobe.

 The Tamarin just-in-time compiler (the "NanoJIT") is a collaboratively developed component
used by both Tamarin and Mozilla TraceMonkey.
The !ActionScript compiler is available as a component from the open source Flex SDK

Without Tamarin, redtamarin would not exists, so kudos to Adobe to have open sourced this fantastic project.
