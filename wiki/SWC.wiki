#summary about the SWC format.

== Introduction ==

A SWC is a library used to shared various components in a zipped form.

It can contains
  * pre-compiled code
  * visual components
  * assets, images, fonts, etc.

With Tamarin you don't really care about SWC<br>
except for one thing: supporting syntax completion in an IDE.

Most of the editors out there
  * Flex Builder 3
  * Flash Builder 4
  * FDT
  * Flash Develop
  * etc.

use the content of one or more SWC to allow syntax completion in the IDE.


== Details ==

Our main problem is that the general SWC out there is generated by COMPC<br>
which reuse `airglobal.swc` or `playerglobal.swc` and compile `*.as` strictly formated code.

As it is, you can not reuse those defaults to create a SWC based on code for Tamarin
  * you can not re-use the `*.abc` files
  * the `*.as` builtin, shell and native classes are not necessarily strictly formated

but there is a trick we can use :).

Thanks to [http://www.victordramba.com/ Victor Dramba] for this trick,<br>
it really made me see the light when I thought no solutions could be found ;).

the trick
 * you can handcraft a very minimalist `builtin.swc`
 * based on what you can find in `playerglobal.swc`
 * very minimalist as you declare only the *builtin* types (Object, Class, Function, etc.)
 * then you can reuse this `builtin.swc` to compile with COMPC others `*.swc` with your native classes

At the condition that you organize your native classes in a strict manner<br>
(eg. only one public per file, one file for each public definition, use typing, etc.)<br>
COMPC will gladly compile the SWC for you.

But even with that, let's analyze what is a SWC.

A SWC is a a ZIP file with the extension `*.swc` which contains 2 files
  * catalog.xml
  * library.swf

When you look at the Flex SDK source code<br>
[http://opensource.adobe.com/svn/opensource/flex/sdk/trunk/modules/compiler/src/java/flex2/compiler/swc/catalog/CatalogWriter.java /modules/compiler/src/java/flex2/compiler/swc/catalog/CatalogWriter.java]

you can learn few other things about `catalog.xml`

catalog.xml will always have this header
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding ="utf-8"?>
<swc xmlns="http://www.adobe.com/flash/swccatalog/9">
}}}

followed by a version tag
{{{
  <versions>
    <swc version="1.0" />
    <flex version="2.0" build="0" />
  </versions>
}}}

there the versions can change depending on which version of the Flex SDK you are using<br>
here another one from `playerglobal.swc` for FP10 in the Flex SDK 4
{{{
  <versions>
    <swc version="1.2" />
    <flex version="4.0.0" build="0" />
  </versions>
}}}
