#summary about the ActionScript Compiler.

=== Introduction ===

The !ActionScript Compiler 2.0, or *ASC2*, has been introduced as part of the AIR 3.4/FP 11.4 SDK preview
and Flash Builder 4.7 Preview.

*ASC2* is now distributed with *Flash CC* (Flash C++ Compiler) and the *AIR SDK* (since AIR 3.6).

Written in Java, and distributed as a Jar file (asc2.jar), same as ASC<br>
it allows to compile `*.as` source code to an `*.abc` file ([ABC ActionScript Byte Code]),<br>
or to a `*.swf` file, or to an executable file.

=== Improvements ===

 * Flash Builder 4.7 and the ASC 2.0 command-line compiler now share the same code model. This avoids duplicate representations of a program and means the IDE has an accurate representation of the language - matching the compiler.
 * A new multi-threaded architecture allows multiple files to be compiled at once, improving compilation time.
 * Better constant-folding and constant-propagation results in better performing code at runtime.
 * Reduces function overhead by removing unnecessary activation records.
 * Contains some demonstration byte-code optimizations for in-lining and dead code elimination.
 * Non-linear control flow added to AS3 through a new 'goto' keyword.
 * SWF 13 with LZMA compression is now supported.
 * A new symbol management system means Flash Builder 4.7 ActionScript workspaces that mix Flash and AIR projects should incrementally compile much faster.
 * ASC 2.0 based versions of fontswf, optimizer, swfdump and swcdepends command-line tools are available.
 * Font transcoding has been removed from [Embed] syntax. Fonts should be pre-transcoded and embedded as a SWF, which can be performed using a tool like fontswf or Flash Professional CS6.
 * Relative paths in source code ([Embed] assets, includes, etc...) resolve relatively from the including file. To specify a path relative from a source root, prefix your path with a forward slash '/'.
 * US English compiler error messages have been translated into French, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese. The locale is determined by the JVM and can be overridden using the -tools-locale configuration option.
 * Added support for inlining. When the inlining feature is enabled, the compiler will attempt to inline getters, setters and any functions which are decorated with [Inline] metadata.
 * Added support for fast memory opcodes
