#summary AVMPlus Operating System class.

<wiki:comment>
Because we are defining libraries for Tamarin we can not really use asdoc to document the source code.
So the rule is to document everything in the wiki page.
Yeah it sucks because we have to sync by hand, we'll try to automate it later.

on the source code file, we use only one comment

/* documentation: http://code.google.com/p/redtamarin/wiki/C_stdlib */
