#summary all about the projectors.

=== Introduction ===

A projector is a command-line executable that embed an `*.abc` file with the avmshell (or redshell in our case).

This the *MOST IMPORTANT* feature for redtamarin as it allows to create a single executable and so distribute easily your programs.

With Flash a projector have the following workflow:
 * you create a `*.swf` file
 * you open this `*.swf` with the Standalone Flash Player
 * from the menu `File/Create Projector ...`
 * save

this basically merge the Flash Player `*.exe` and the `*.swf` into one executable.

With Tamarin it is basically the same thing but with some subtle differences.

You can only generate a projector with [ASC]

for example
{{{
$ java -jar asc.jar -AS3 -import builtin.abc -import shell_toplevel.abc -exe redshell testcli.as
}}}

the `-exe` option
{{{
-exe <avmplus path> = emit an EXE file (projector)
}}}

this will create a `testcli.abc` and a `testcli.exe`

the `testcli.exe` merge the `redshell` executable and the `testcli.abc`

This is cool and all but we end up with some issues
 * ASC can not generate a projector from a `*.swf` file
 * the default `avmshell` is more a tool to test the AVM<br>and focus less on executing projectors<br>even if there are plenty of support funtions to do that
