#summary API reference.

== Introduction ==

from v0.4 we have a brand new API design, here the context and rules.

 * we embed in the runtime (redshell) all core and essential libraries<br>so we can access them at all time without the need to load them first.
 * we split our API in 3 distinct parts:
   * CLIB: C libraries, the lowest level
   * RNL: Native libraries, system level
   * AVMGlue: framework libraries, high level
 * any other code or libraries is user level<br>either constitute the main program or external library to load
 * by default we are synchronous, blocking and use function callbacks
 * we then provide options to allow the user to be asynchronous, non-blocking and use events
 * an API definition can have those states
   * not implemented
   * not supported
   * stub/mock/fake implementation
   * implemented
