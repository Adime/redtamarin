#summary notes about cross-platform C/C++.

== Introduction ==

If writing C/C++ on one Operating System can be hard,<br>
writing C/C++ for more than one Operating System is a bitch.

And when you try to do that when you are a C/C++ noob<br>
it's like trying to make ice cube in a god damn fucking hell.

SO here some notes to keep my sanity :).

== Resetting data in a char array ==

Let's say you want to receive data in a buffer (char array) and while in a loop reset the data

first attempt
{{{
char buffer[1024];

buffer[0] = '\0';

//your loop
}}}

this in theory should work everywhere, as a char array contain 1 char per index,
if you set the first index to be null terminated, then another function should see your char array as empty

well ...on some POSIX it is working like that, but not everywhere (not WIN32)

so yeah you really HAVE TO clean it up the proper way
{{{
char buffer[1024];

memset( &buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer) );

//your loop
}}}
